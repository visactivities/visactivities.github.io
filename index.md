More information on the individual calls below.

## üî•Motivation: 
Workshops, classes, or collaborations with domain experts often include hands-on data visualization activities that involve analog or digital tools and materials as well as more or less well-defined protocols. Recent years have seen the emergence of such data visualization activities in different contexts, including education, design, activism, and interdisciplinary collaboration. While many of these activities naturally take place in a group setting, due to the social distancing measures during the Covid-19 more and more of these activities are now happening online. The VisActivities workshop is a venue where researchers, practitioners, and educators from within and outside of the visualization community discuss goals, methods, audiences, materials and challenges they face when conducting and organising activities. It is also an opportunity where we can brainstorm, design and try novel activities collectively.

## üìùWorkshop papers: 
We invite a wide range of research papers. Contributions can include: visualization activities, online platforms for activities, learning material, learning goals, taxonomies, visualization guidelines, critical reflections on conducting visualization activities (teaching experience), evaluation strategies for activities, teaching approaches, ethical and critical considerations on activities and teaching.  Reports on activities could include procedures, reports and experiences about one or many teaching activities, including a protocol and material of activities including results and reflections. Materials could include new teaching material that supports teaching in general and which is ready for application (slides, visualizations of schema/diagrams/design spaces, cheat sheets, teaching tools), or targeted to support specific activities (physical visualization, sketching templates, programming tutorials). We are particularly interested in ideas about evaluations for both activities and materials.

## ‚öΩÔ∏è Activity description: 
In the 2nd VisActivities workshop, we want to give participants the opportunity to share their activities in the way they were meant to be disseminated: by running them. We therefore invite applications to run an online activity regarding visualization education, design, activism, interdisciplinary collaboration or beyond. Activities can include, for example, sketching aids for idea generation, toolkits for visualisation design, protocols with tangible tokens to help conceptualize quantities for data visualization; sketching exercises to help activists or other stakeholders better understand social issues etc.

Requirements: The suggested activity must be adapted to online settings, could account for approximately  1 hour or less and expect a double digit number of participants. The suggested activities do not need to be polished: the workshop settings offer a great platform and audience from which to build upon. Upon request the workshop organisers can help with the facilitation.

## üòÇ Challenges : 
As part of the workshop program, we are collecting opinions and position statements on visualization education and teaching. We are especially looking to gather challenges and questions regarding experiences, methodologies, activities that educators face when teaching data visualisation concepts in light of Covid-19 but also more broadly. 

These challenges will be collected and organised into themes to help scaffold discussions during the workshop. Depending on participants‚Äô interest these discussions could also form the basis for a shared viewpoint publication of what the community could be working towards.

Format : 200 word text summarizing your positions about the main issues / challenges about teaching visualization. Submissions can choose to stay anonymous. Participation form: [https://forms.gle/y6qvf6LcrJSJcrkw7](https://forms.gle/y6qvf6LcrJSJcrkw7)

‚ù§Ô∏è Enjoy your summer ‚ù§Ô∏è



# Previous Call 

This workshop on _Data Vis Activities to Facilitate Learning, Reflecting, Discussing, and Designing_ focuses on __data-visualization activities__, especially methods and challenges for teaching and engaging with data visualization concepts, knowledge, and practices. The deadline for submitting a paper or a lightning talk to the workshop is __July-4th, 2021__.

On a similar thematic, <a href="https://www.computer.org/digital-library/magazines/cg/call-for-papers-special-issue-on-visualization-education-and-teaching-visualization-literacy" target="_blank">CG&A Special Issue on Visualization Education and Teaching Visualization Literacy</a> has its deadline on __April-28th, 2021__. 

For both we welcome submissions from across the fields. 

## Topics & Goals:
Workshops, classes, or collaborations with domain experts often include hands-on data visualization activities that involve analog or digital tools and materials as well as more or less well-defined protocols. Recent years have seen the emergence of such data visualization activities in different contexts, including education, visualization design, activism, self-reflection, and interdisciplinary collaboration: for example, sketching aids designers to consider alternative ideas; manipulating tokens help students conceptualize quantities for data visualization; user interviews and discussions help developers understand requirements manipulating data help activist better understand social issues, etc.

While many of these activities would naturally take place in a group setting, due to **the social distancing measures during the Covid-19 more and more of these activities are now happening online.** Switching from co-located and synchronous activities to remote and sometimes asynchronous activities, changed the way we teach or design data visualization. This required teachers and designers to reinvent activities, adapt materials to be suitable for online delivery, reorganise procedures, replace physical tools with virtual, rethink collaboration and engagement, restructure or invent new activities. At the same time, moving activities online opens new possibilities to involve people across the world and in turn increase diversity and access.

**The goals of this workshop are:**
Building an understanding and to synthesize protocols and materials used to lead data vis activities (online and offline), to bring together researchers, practitioners, and educators from within and outside of the visualization community, brainstorm, design, experience, and try novel activities, and to discuss issues around goals, methods, audiences, materials, and evaluation for teaching data visualization. And also exchanges about the best teaching moment of the year.

## Submissions: 

All submissions are submitted using PCS: https://new.precisionconference.com
The is [standard IEEE style](http://vgtc.org/publications/journal).



* __Workshop papers__, refer to classical research papers with a scientific contribution in theory, reflection, application, evaluation, design, or implementation. Page length will be limited to 4 pages TVCG/VIS style. Contributions can include: visualization activities, online platforms for activities, learning material, learning goals, taxonomies, visualization guidelines, critical reflections on conducting visualization activities (teaching experience), evaluation strategies for activities, teaching approaches, ethical and critical considerations on activities and teaching.  Reports on activities should include procedures, reports and experiences about one or many teaching activities, including a protocol and material of activities including results and reflections. Materials should include new teaching material that supports teaching in general and which is ready for application (slides, visualizations of schema/diagrams/design spaces, cheat sheets, teaching tools), or targeted to support specific activities (physical visualization, sketching templates, programming tutorials). We encourage evaluations for both activities and materials.

* __Lightning Talks__, refer to fast 2 minutes presentations of anecdotes, experiences and best experience specifically regarding online vis activities. These can discuss best teaching moments, activity reports, materials, tools, set-up etc in a brief concise way (4-5 slides) with the possibility of including additional material on the workshop website. Submission page length will be limited to 1 page briefly outlining the experience (only the abstract and a picture are mandatory) with any additional material added as an appendix. Lightning talks could also be picked for the Ice breaker: Fast forward testimony of best (teaching) moment of the year. The goal of these (casual) talks is to inspire, exchange nuggets of knowledge, provoke, trigger conversation and have fun.


Any submission will be peer-reviewed, providing constructive feedback for the camera-ready version. All submissions will be published on and linked from our website.
