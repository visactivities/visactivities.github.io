## IEEE VIS Workshop on Data Vis Activities, 2021

This workshop on _Data Vis Activities to Facilitate Learning, Reflecting, Discussing, and Designing_ focuses on __data-visualization activities__, especially methods and challenges for teaching and engaging with data visualization concepts, knowledge, and practices. A  <a href="https://www.computer.org/digital-library/magazines/cg/call-for-papers-special-issue-on-visualization-education-and-teaching-visualization-literacy" target="_blank">CG&A Special Issue on Visualization Education and Teaching Visualization Literacy</a> is scheduled for 2021 and has its deadline on July-4th, 2021. We welcome submissions from across the fields. 

## Topics & Goals:
Workshops, classes, or collaborations with domain experts often include hands-on data visualization activities that involve analog or digital tools and materials as well as more or less well-defined protocols. Recent years have seen the emergence of such data visualization activities in different contexts, including education, visualization design, activism, self-reflection, and interdisciplinary collaboration: for example, sketching aids designers to consider alternative ideas; ,manipulating tokens help students conceptualize quantities for data visualization; user interviews and discussions help developers understand requirements manipulating data help activist better understand social issues, etc.

While many of these activities would naturally take place in a group setting, due to **the social distancing measures during the Covid-19 more and more of these activities are now happening online.** Switching from co-located and synchronous activities to remote and sometimes asynchronous activities, changed the way we teach or design data visualization. This required teachers and designers to reinvent activities, adapt materials to be suitable for online delivery, reorganise procedures, replace physical tools with virtual, rethink collaboration and engagement, restructure or invent new activities. At the same time, moving activities online opens new possibilities to involve people across the world and in turn increase diversity and access.

**The goals of this workshop are:**
Building an understanding and to synthesize protocols and materials used to lead data vis activities (online and offline), to bring together researchers, practitioners, and educators from within and outside of the visualization community, brainstorm, design, experience, and try novel activities, and to discuss issues around goals, methods, audiences, materials, and evaluation for teaching data visualization. And also exchanges about the best teaching moment of the year.



## Topics and Submissions: 

All submissions are submitted using PCS: https://new.precisionconference.com
The is [standard IEEE style](http://vgtc.org/publications/journal).



* __Workshop papers__, refer to classical research papers with a scientific contribution in theory, reflection, application, evaluation, design, or implementation. Page length will be limited to 4 pages TVCG/VIS style. Contributions can include: visualization activities, online platforms for activities, learning material, learning goals, taxonomies, visualization guidelines, critical reflections on conducting visualization activities (teaching experience), evaluation strategies for activities, teaching approaches, ethical and critical considerations on activities and teaching.  Reports on activities should include procedures, reports and experiences about one or many teaching activities, including a protocol and material of activities including results and reflections. Materials should include new teaching material that supports teaching in general and which is ready for application (slides, visualizations of schema/diagrams/design spaces, cheat sheets, teaching tools), or targeted to support specific activities (physical visualization, sketching templates, programming tutorials). We encourage evaluations for both activities and materials.

* __Lightning Talks__, refer to fast 2 minutes presentations of anecdotes, experiences and best experience specifically regarding online vis activities. These can discuss best teaching moments, activity reports, materials, tools, set-up etc in a brief concise way (4-5 slides) with the possibility of including additional material on the workshop website. Submission page length will be limited to 1 page briefly outlining the experience (only the abstract and a picture are mandatory) with any additional material added as an appendix. Lightning talks could also be picked for the Ice breaker: Fast forward testimony of best (teaching) moment of the year. The goal of these (casual) talks is to inspire, exchange nuggets of knowledge, provoke, trigger conversation and have fun.


Any submission will be peer-reviewed, providing constructive feedback for the camera-ready version. All submissions will be published on and linked from our website and authors of workshop paper can choose to publish their accepted submissions in the IEEE DL.
