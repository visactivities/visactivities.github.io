## IEEE VIS Workshop on Data Vis Activities, 2020

This workshop on _Data Vis Activities to Facilitate Learning, Reflecting, Discussing, and Designing_ focuses on __data-visualization activities__, especially methods and challenges for teaching and engaging with data visualization concepts, knowledge, and practices. A  <a href="https://www.computer.org/digital-library/magazines/cg/call-for-papers-special-issue-on-visualization-education-and-teaching-visualization-literacy" target="_blank">CG&A Special Issue on Visualization Education and Teaching Visualization Literacy</a> is scheduled for 2021 and has its deadline on April-28, 2021. We welcome submissions from across the fields. 

## Topics & Goals:
Workshops, classes, or collaborations with domain experts, often include hands-on data visualization activities that involve analog ordigital tools and materials and more or less well defined protocols. Recent years have seen the emergence of such data visualizationactivities in different contexts, including education, visualization design, activism, self-reflection, and interdisciplinary collaboration. However, the  broad  range of contexts and  target audiences that Data-Vis activities have been applied to makes it difficult to collectand identify commonalities and build knowledge in a systematic way. Download our [full proposal here](VIS2020_Teaching_Workshop.pdf).

The goals of this workshop are:

* start __building an understanding__ and to synthesize protocols and materials used to lead data vis activities,
* to __bring together__ researchers, practitioners, and educators from within and outside of the visualization community,
* __brainstorm, design__, experience, and try novel activities, and to 
* __discuss issues__ around goals, methods, audiences, materials, andevaluation for teaching data visualization.


## Schedule:

_The workshop will take place online on __Monday Oct 26, 8:00am-11:25am (Mountain Time, USA)__. To access the workshop you can register __for free__ on [IEEE VIS WEBSITE](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/info/registration/conference-registration)._

The schedule is split into two sessions. The first session features paper presentations; the second feaures a hands-on discussion on topics related to Vis activities and Vis teaching and aims to create and discuss (novel) vis activities. As we are seeking topics from the community, __please add any questions, remarks or topics to the collective note taking document__ during the paper sessions. We use these notes to inform the Q&A sessions and the discussion in part II of the workshop.

## Topics and Submissions: 

* Style: [standard IEEE style](http://vgtc.org/publications/journal)
* Submission: [PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com)

__Research__ refers to classical workshop papers with a scientific contribution in theory, reflection, application, evaluation, design, or implementation. Page length will be limited to 4 pages. Contributions can include: 
* activities, 
* learning material,
* learning goals,
* taxonomies,
* visualization guidelines,
* critical reflections on conducing visualization activities (teaching experience),
* evaluation strategies for activities, 
* teaching approaches, 
* ethical and critical considerations on activities and teaching.
* ...

__Activities__ include 
* procedures, 
* reports and 
* experiences about one or many teaching activities, e.g., protocol and material of activities including results and reflections. 


As part of the call, we will provide a [template to report and explain an activity](activity-template). Activities should be in PDF format and will be published in this format on the workshop website. This template will be subject to discussion by the workshop participants during the workshop.

__Materials__ include new teaching material that supports teaching in general and which is ready for application 
* slides, 
* visualizations of schema/diagrams/design spaces, 
* [cheat sheets](http://visualizationcheatsheets.github.io) ([full paper](https://visualizationcheatsheets.github.io/Wang2020cheatsheets.pdf)), 
* teaching tools
* targeted to support specific activities 
  * physical visualization, 
  * sketching templates, 
  * programming tutorials
  * ... 
  

A material submission should not exceed __2 pages text plus appendix and supplementary material__ (e.g., graphics, videos, websites). The 2 pages should describe context, design decisions, associated or possible activities, and reflections or evaluations from their application. The actual material is to be included as supplementary material and can be presented as poster at the workshop.

Any submission—research, activity, or material—will be peer-reviewed, providing constructive feedback for the camera-ready version. All submissions will be published on and linked from our website. On submission, authors have to choose whether their a successful submission should be made archival or should only be available on the workshop website.
