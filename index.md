## IEEE VIS Workshop on Data Vis Activities, 2021

This workshop on _Data Vis Activities to Facilitate Learning, Reflecting, Discussing, and Designing_ focuses on __data-visualization activities__, especially methods and challenges for teaching and engaging with data visualization concepts, knowledge, and practices. A  <a href="https://www.computer.org/digital-library/magazines/cg/call-for-papers-special-issue-on-visualization-education-and-teaching-visualization-literacy" target="_blank">CG&A Special Issue on Visualization Education and Teaching Visualization Literacy</a> is scheduled for 2021 and has its deadline on April-28, 2021. We welcome submissions from across the fields. 

## Topics & Goals:
Workshops, classes, or collaborations with domain experts, often include hands-on data visualization activities that involve analog ordigital tools and materials and more or less well defined protocols. Recent years have seen the emergence of such data visualizationactivities in different contexts, including education, visualization design, activism, self-reflection, and interdisciplinary collaboration. However, the  broad  range of contexts and  target audiences that Data-Vis activities have been applied to makes it difficult to collectand identify commonalities and build knowledge in a systematic way.

The goals of this workshop are:

* start __building an understanding__ and to synthesize protocols and materials used to lead data vis activities,
* to __bring together__ researchers, practitioners, and educators from within and outside of the visualization community,
* __brainstorm, design__, experience, and try novel activities, and to 
* __discuss issues__ around goals, methods, audiences, materials, andevaluation for teaching data visualization.


## Topics and Submissions: 

* Style: [standard IEEE style](http://vgtc.org/publications/journal)
* Submission: [PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com)

__Research__ refers to classical workshop papers with a scientific contribution in theory, reflection, application, evaluation, design, or implementation. Page length will be limited to 4 pages. Contributions can include: 
* activities, 
* learning material,
* learning goals,
* taxonomies,
* visualization guidelines,
* critical reflections on conducing visualization activities (teaching experience),
* evaluation strategies for activities, 
* teaching approaches, 
* ethical and critical considerations on activities and teaching.
* ...


Any submission—research, activity, or material—will be peer-reviewed, providing constructive feedback for the camera-ready version. All submissions will be published on and linked from our website. On submission, authors have to choose whether their a successful submission should be made archival or should only be available on the workshop website.

## Timeline:

* July 4, 2020: Submission Deadline
* July 25, 2020: Reviews Collected from reviewers
* August 3, 2020: Author Notification
* September 17, 2020: Submission Camera Ready Deadline

In case IEEE VIS will not take place physically as scheduled, this workshop will be held online.
